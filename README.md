Status Bar File Size
====================

Displays file size in the Sublime Text status bar. Where possible, the size is
queried from the file system. If this information is not available -- e.g. for
a buffer that was modified and not yet saved -- the file size is estimated from
the buffer contents and chosen encoding.

## Installation

This package only supports Sublime Text 3.

[pkgctrl]: https://packagecontrol.io

## Configuration

The default and user configuration files can be accessed from the Sublime Text
menu bar, *Preferences -> Package Settings -> Status Bar File Size*.
